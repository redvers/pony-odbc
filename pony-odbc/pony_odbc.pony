# ODBC Driver - Under Active Development

If there exists an existing driver for the database you wish to use
you should probably use that.

This documentation is aimed at anyone who wants to write an ODBC
driver for their database of choice. It would probably be unwise to
do this until I have this API stable.

To see how a database driver is written, PostgreSQL is our first.
