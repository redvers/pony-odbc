## Misc bugfixes specific to mariadb.

Differences in versions required the following changes:

* SQLExecute execution returns SQLSuccess in newer versions instead of
  SQLSuccessWithInfo. We now need to validate the buffers for every both
  SQLSucess and SQLSuccessWithInfo.
* When providing syntactically invalid SQL to SQLPrepare, newer versions
  throw a SQLError on SQLPrepare, older versions on the SQLExecute (like
  all other tested connectors).
* ODBCDbc will no longer apply SQL\_AUTOCOMMIT after a connection is made
  in more recent versions.
